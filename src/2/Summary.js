                As a seasoned Front End Developer with experience from 2014 to 2023, I possess a deep understanding of developing scalable and user-friendly web applications. Throughout the years, I have honed my technical skills in JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, and other front-end technologies. While working as a PMO Project Manager, I successfully developed and managed various projects, enhanced operational methods, and monitored performance.
                As the Idea Owner and CEO of a startup with over 100 employees, I led my team to create a widely-used application that provided a viable alternative to traditional school education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This venture allowed me to combine my front-end development expertise and entrepreneurial spirit to produce something meaningful and impactful.
                In my recent work, I have continued to expand my skillset by working on front-end projects and developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. With my diverse background, I excel at collaborating with cross-functional teams, managing projects, and delivering high-quality results.
